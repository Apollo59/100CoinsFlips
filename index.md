## Hello Im ApolloPluto and this is a CoinFlipping Program made because my teacher decided to say some stuff about coins.


# How you run the file is you go to Net6.0 and click CoinFlipping.exe and after you run the program a file with ones going down should be in your documents now just count the ones and that is how many heads the coin landed on.
